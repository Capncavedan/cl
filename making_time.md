# How to make time

Block it out on your calendar. Seriously. Block. It. Out.

One hour first thing in the morning a couple of times a week

Wear headphones! Even/especially if you're just reading.

Your lunch hour a couple of days a week: eat and watch/listen

Commute time obviously good for podcasts

Workout time is also

Night is actually bad for most people; your brain is fried
